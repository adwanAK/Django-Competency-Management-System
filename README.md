2. <h2> Scop Managment Plan:</h2>
    <h4>2.1 Define Scope (requirements):</h4> <ul>
        <li> Project is small to medium software size so we do not expect much deviation from original defined scope.</li> Project must include model & db, views control code, html templates and javascript for better UI/UX.</li>
        Solid back end and basic front end pages can do the job, however, user-friendly front end is also required.</li>
        <li> A user will log in with his coporate identity, checks the list of tasks of the day (can do check all button).</li>
        If user did not complete daily task, he can mark that on the check list as (Yes/No). Submission go up one level for supervisor approval.</li>
        <li> The supervisor then receives all today's users submission, then can check all okay by one click or navigate to user to mark any task that user did not complete. The idea is for the user to evaluates himself and that supervisor is only confirming submission to record in the system db. Supervisor can submit attachment as an evidence.</li>
        <li> The above data will be instance of one shift (one submission cycle). At the end of the shift this whole process should take 2 minutes from user time and 10 mins max from supervisor time.</li>
        <li> Each team or teams work in one location with unique location id. i.e. Joanic Station. Other teams will be assigned for other location ID i.e. Trinita Nova station.</li>
        <li> Technologies used: Python Django, MySQL, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
        <li> Branding and identity must follow company profile.</li> </ul>
